A simple website to show my CV and my interests.

Ideas for next implementations in interactive simulations:
- S(qx,qy) in molecular dynamics
- NPT in molecular dynamics
- event-driven MD
- constant-magnetization Ising model
- disordered Ising model: simulate two replicas and plot the distribution of the overlap parameter P(q)
- minimization algorithms over landscapes
