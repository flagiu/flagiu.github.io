  <p>Why are there 12 musical notes?</p>
  <p>Starting from a pure sound wave with a given pitch (e.g. A4 with frequency 440Hz), if you multiply or divide the frequency by a power of 2 you get the same pitch but on a different octave: A3 220Hz, A5 880Hz, ...</p>
  <p>We can say that the replica of a pitch f0 along all possible octaves are the same apart from a factor 2^n, with n integer.</p>
  <p>For math fans, its convenient to say that log2(f0*2^n) are equal to log2(f0) modulo 1.</p>
  <p>When things are periodic, its convenient to represent them on a circle.</p>
  <p>Let's plot any frequency f by mapping x = log2(f) mod 1 to the angle of a circle: 0 when x=0, 360Â° when x=1.</p>
  <p>All equivalent pitches will fall on the same point.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>What happens if you multiply f0 by an integer q which is not a power of 2? Let's try the simplest one: q=3.</p>
  <p>The note with frequency f0*3 will fall on a different point on the circle, so it has a different pitch.</p>
  <p>Let's multiply it again by 3: f0*3^2 will fall on another point on the circle.</p>
  <p>By iterating, we find that after the 12th iteration we cover the circle with almost equally spaced points.</p>
